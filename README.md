# Bubble Tea Randomizer

## About:

##### Unsure of what to order?

Introducing, Bubble Tea Randomizer, the solution to all your worries... well, if they are store specific (:

This is a custom [^1] piece of code, made for a specific store nearby the area. That being said, the pre-processing steps could\* be generalized into something that works with a simple picture that could be uploaded to then generate the random selections.

## TODO:

- Generalize to any store, if a picture is uploaded.
  - See if textract is available to call through vanilla js
  - Convert python process -> vanilla js

[^1]: Custom as in, made primarily for myself. If they bring value to others that's great, but the license is MIT :).
